## QuickStart
If you're clone the first time, it's highly recommended you clone it into your documents folder so it's easier to find.  

In the terminal:
```
cd; cd Documents; git clone https://github.com/csula-acm-upperclassman/Accord.git
```
Once you finished cloning the repository, install all dependenices from package.json:
```
npm install
```
To run in localhost:
```
npm start
```

Inside the terminal, to terminate the server:
```
Ctrl + c
```
