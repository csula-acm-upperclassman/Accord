Project Repo

The project for the React Workshop will be a single-page application that takes inspiration from Discord and Slack. Students who participate will be working in groups that will all contribute to a single production application. The code will be managed with GitHub. Each group will be responsible for managing their assigned branch in the repository which will have a series of issues associated with it. 

Group Divisions (each group will only work on whatâ€™s listed)

For this project we will be covering two types of Components, Non-View Components and View Components. 

Non-View Components and View Components are essentially the same, but they serve different purposes. The root Non-View Component (App), for this project, will be composed of View Components that contain Non-View Components or View Components.

Note: View Components can be replaced, but Non-View Components should not be. Divs are simply div tags contained within the respective component (view and non-view)
